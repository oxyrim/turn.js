                <p> Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties atthe National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in theNetherlands.Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++,Algol-68, SmallTalk, Unix shell, and other scripting languages.Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNUGeneral Public License (GPL).Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, althoughGuido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>

                <p>Python's features include:
                     
                    <br>Easy-to-learn:
                     
                    Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearlydefined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
                    <br>Easy-to-read:
                    Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
                    <br>Easy-to-maintain:
                    Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.

                    <br>A broad standard library:
                    Python's bulk of the library is very portable andcross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.

                    <br>Interactive Mode:                
                    Python has 
                    support for an interactive

                <p>Python distribution is available for a wide variety of platforms. You need to downloadonly the binary code applicable for your platform and install Python.If the binary code for your platform is not available, you need a C compiler to compilethe source code manually. Compiling the source code offers more flexibility in termsof choice of features that you require in your installation.</p>

                    Programs and other executable files can be in many directories, so operating systemsprovide a search path that lists the directories that the OS searches for executables.The path is stored in an environment variable, which is a named string maintainedby the operating system. This variable contains information available to the commandshell and other programs.The
                     
                    path
                     
                    variable is named as PATH in Unix or Path in Windows (Unix is case-sensitive; Windows is not).In Mac OS, the installer handles the path details. To invoke the Python interpreterfrom any particular directory, you must add the Python directory to your path</p>

                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scriptinglanguage. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywordsfrequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntacticalconstructions than other languages
                    Python is Interpreted: 
                    Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter.You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similarto PERL and PHP.
                    Python is Interactive:
                    You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interactwith the interpreter directly to write your programs.
                    Python is Object-Oriented:
                    Python supports Object-Oriented style ortechnique </p>
